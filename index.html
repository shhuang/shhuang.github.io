          I am a final-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by
          Professors <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel</a>
          and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/">Anca Dragan</a>.
          I have a B.S. from Stanford in CS (Artificial Intelligence track).
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
        My research focuses on building a deeper understanding of exactly what a robot or agent
        has learned. For instance, engineers should have an idea of which
        situations their robot may act incorrectly in, and end-users should be able to
        anticipate how a robot they are interacting with will behave in various situations.
        This is essential for building trust, enabling seamless human-robot collaboration,
        verifying what a robot has learned, and deploying robots in safety-critical situations.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          I previously worked on teaching robots how to manipulate deformable objects
          (knot tying and towel folding) through learning from demonstrations.
          While at Stanford, I applied machine learning to problems in clinical
          decision making and information flow tracking.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Outside of academics, I am involved in STEM outreach and mentoring.
          I like running, yoga, tea, baking, and board game nights.

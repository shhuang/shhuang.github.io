          I am currently a Research Scientist at <a href="http://deepmind.google/">Google DeepMind</a>, where
          I work on reinforcement learning algorithms and applications for
          robot learning, including recently for robot soccer and whole-body control.

          I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by
          Professors <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel</a>
          and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/">Anca Dragan</a>.
          I have a B.S. from Stanford in CS, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.

        My <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-115.html">Ph.D. thesis</a>
        focused on how we can give humans a better understanding
        of what a robot has learned and what its capabilities are. 
        For instance, engineers should have an idea of which
        situations their robot may act incorrectly in, and end-users should be able to
        anticipate how a robot they are interacting with will behave in various situations.
        This is essential for building trust, enabling seamless human-robot collaboration,
        verifying what a robot has learned, and deploying robots in safety-critical situations.

          Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, running, yoga, and board game nights!
